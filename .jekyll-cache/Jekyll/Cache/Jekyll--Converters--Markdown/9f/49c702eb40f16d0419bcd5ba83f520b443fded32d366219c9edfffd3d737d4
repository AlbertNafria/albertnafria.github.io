I"ä<p>This room is a pretty short and very straightforward one. Itâ€™s part of the <strong>Comptia
Pentest+</strong> path. Hydra is a pentest tool for cracking paswords with brute force.
The first task of the room is about what is that tool for and how to install it.
As it says, Hydra <em>bruteforces</em> authentication in SSH, Web Application Forms,
FTP and SNMP. Also thereâ€™s a long list of protocols Hydra has the ability to
crack. Itâ€™s an essential tool for the pentester.</p>
