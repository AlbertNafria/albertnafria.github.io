I"ð<p>This room is very short comared to others and very straightforward. Itâ€™s part
of the <strong>Comptia Pentest+</strong> path. Hydra is a pentest tool for cracking paswords
with brute force.  The first task of the room is about what is that tool for and
how to install it.  As it says, Hydra <em>bruteforces</em> authentication in SSH, Web
Application Forms, FTP and SNMP. Also thereâ€™s a long list of protocols Hydra has
the ability to crack. Itâ€™s an essential tool for the pentester.</p>
