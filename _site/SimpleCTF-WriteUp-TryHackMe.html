  <h2>Simple CTF WriteUp TryHackMe</h2>
  <time datetime="2021-11-30T15:45:15+01:00" class="by-line">30 Nov 2021</time>
  <p>Simple CTF is a beginner level room on TryHackMe. There are few questions that
guide you in which steps have to be done. It took me few hours to complete it as
I found problems running the exploit, a python script. First I needed to solve
some dependencies, I also modified the code to adapt it to Python3 and finally
it worked till the moment of cracking the password.</p>

<p>Firs, as always, I started enumerating the system. Here is the output of this
nmap command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nmap <span class="nt">-sCV</span> &lt;ip-address&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="img/simpleCTF/nmap.png" alt="nmap" /></p>

<p>Whith this information I could answer some of the questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many services are running under port 1000?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What is running on the higher port?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It has the port 80 open, so I typed the ip in my browser and it displayed the
default’s apache page. So I run <strong>gobuster</strong> to find hidden directories.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gobuster <span class="nb">dir</span> <span class="nt">-u</span> http://&lt;ip-address&gt; <span class="nt">-x</span> -.txt,.php,.html <span class="nt">-w</span> /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt <span class="nt">-t</span> 64 <span class="nt">-q</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="img/simpleCTF/gobuster.png" alt="gobuster" /></p>

<p>It shows the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/simple</code> directory, which could be exploited. Here’s a</p>

<p>Here the point is that this site is using a CMS called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMS made simple</code>,
version 2.2.8. I when to <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/">exploit DB</a> and search
for exploits for this application. There’s one for that version, and I could
answer the next question:</p>

<p><img src="img/simpleCTF/exploitDB.png" alt="exploitDB" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>What’s the CVE you’re using against the application?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: CVE-2019-9053</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>To what kind of vulnerability is the application vulnerable?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: SQLi</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This exploit is the 46635.py and I tried to run it with this command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/46635.py <span class="nt">-u</span> http://&lt;ip-address&gt;/simple <span class="nt">--crack</span> <span class="nt">-w</span> /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point I could answer the next two questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What’s the password?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret</code></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Where can you login with the details obtained?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Having the user and his password I was able to ssh into the machine and read the
user’s flag. Also they ask if there’s another user in the home directory</p>

<ul>
  <li>What’s the user flag?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G00d j0b, keep up!</code></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Is there any other user in the home directory? What’s its name?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunbath</code></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In order to escalate privileges I tried with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo -l</code> and found that you can
run vim as root without the password. That’s an easy one, so in vim as root I
executed the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:!sh</code> and immediately had a root shell. I could read the
root flag and answer the last questions to complete the room.</p>

<p><img src="img/simpleCTF/root.png" alt="ssh" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>What can you leverage to spawn a privileged shell?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What’s the root flag?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W3ll d0n3. You made it!</code></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
