## eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) Walktrhough

## Skillset

Even we are talking about a beginner entry-level certification in penetration
testing, the exploitation phases I went through were considerably easy. No need
to code exploits or even to modify existing ones. Everything can be done through
metasploit or using legitimate tools after getting some credentials.

I think one of the most important skills required is a good understanding on the
Linux Command Line. I consider that the fact I've been using Linux for few years
has helped me a lot in passing it, many points were thanks to it.

## Time

48 hours is a lot of time for exploiting every single machine, but is great
having that much and don't hurry up. I took me 18 hours counting the time I
spent having lunch, pauses and even a long hours nap.

## Preparation

The Junior Pentester course offered by INE is good but maybe too long. It takes
160 hours but I think is quite repetitive. It covers the pentester methodology
from the beginning to the end, and some of the phases are not required for
passing successfully the `eJPT`. Moreover, I didn't do any web attack or even
use BurpSuite. On the other hand is good I went through the course because is a
great introduction to a pentester career.

## Walkthrough

When I started, after a quick recon of the network and the identification of the
active machines, I thought it would be extremely complicated. Sometimes I was
blocked in bottlenecks, spending even hours without getting anything, but that's
part of the process. A quick break would give me a solution.

One machine has access to an internal network, from the DMZ Network we got
direct access. To exploit that was pretty easy since there wasn't many machines
on the internal network and was easy to identify the vulnerable one, whith its
services running.

But, as I said before, many questions could be answered just with command line
skills, whithout the use of hacking tools.

I ended up answering everything with only one wrong question, which gave me a
result of 34/35.

## Conclusions

In this post I just wanted to give my opinion about `eJPT`. It was fun to go
through it, the lab is cleverly designed which I appreciate, and I would
recommend it to everyone who likes solving problems and has skills in systems
and networks. Also, the price is very convincing.
